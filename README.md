# About
Chesapeake Bay Interpretive Buoy System (CBIBS) is a set of buoys in the Chesapeake Bay that tracks meteorological, 
oceanographic, and water-quality data up and down the Bay. Monitoring bay conditions is critical to support the health
of the bay. Not only is this data important to monitor the health of the bay, but this information is critical for
sailors racing in the bay. Wind strength, wind direction, current speed, current direction, and many more are critical 
information that sailors racing in the bay can use to their advantage.

# Goal
One of the downsides of CBIBS data is that the data is difficult to visualize and access. The goal of this project is 
pull this data and make it easily accessible to sailors and racers in the bay. Having near-real time updates to wind 
strength and direction is invaluable to all racers in the bay. 

There is also easily available site to view historical data. The goal of this project is to also analyze this data so 
that sailors racing in the Annapolis area have an idea of historical trends for all times of the year.
